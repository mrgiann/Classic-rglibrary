# Classic-rglibrary

Classic-rglibrary is an older version of my personal project called <a href="https://rglibrary.netlify.app/">RgLibrary</a>. When I developed Classic-rglibrary, I had a more limited level of knowledge compared to my current level. This library was created early in my learning, and while it is functional and has been useful for some tasks, I want to make it clear that it has been superseded by my most recent version, <a href="https://rglibrary.netlify.app/">RgLibrary</a>.
